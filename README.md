To use navbar we need to have Python Local Server:

Open a terminal/command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing your HTML files and the navbar.html file.

Run the following command, depending on your version of Python:

For Python 2.x:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

For Python 3.x:
python -m http.server

This will start a local server. You'll see an output indicating the IP address and port where your server is running (e.g., http://localhost:8000).
